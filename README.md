Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning
Supervised Machine Learning (Regression & Classification) 
Built regression and classification models using Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms.
Performed end-to-end data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model optimization using Python and scikit-learn.
Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, R², accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to select best-performing models.

Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction)
Applied DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering to identify natural groupings, detect outliers, and analyze hidden data patterns.
Implemented PCA to reduce dimensionality and reveal underlying feature structure in high-dimensional datasets.
Performed feature scaling, cluster visualization, and interpretability analysis using Python-based data visualization techniques
